## Kikiola Docker Image x Amazon Web Services (AWS)

To push the [Kikiola Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/0xnu20/kikiola/) to [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/), integrate it with Route53, and launch the Docker image with a Lambda function, follow these steps:

1. Push the Docker image to Amazon ECR:

+ Open the Amazon ECR console and create a new repository for your Docker image.
+ Tag your Docker image with the ECR repository URL:

```sh
docker tag 0xnu20/kikiola:latest your-aws-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com/your-repository-name:latest
```

+ Authenticate your Docker client with ECR:

```sh
aws ecr get-login-password --region your-region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin your-aws-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com
```

+ Push the tagged image to ECR:

```sh
docker push your-aws-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com/your-repository-name:latest
```

2. Create a new Lambda function:

+ Open the AWS Lambda console and click on `Create function`.
+ Choose `Container image` as the function type.
+ Provide a name for your function and select `Go 1.x` as the runtime.
+ Under `Container image`, select the ECR repository and the image you pushed in step 1.
+ Configure the necessary settings for your Lambda function, such as the handler, environment variables, and permissions.

3. Integrate with Route53:

+ Open the Amazon Route53 console and create a new hosted zone for your domain (if you haven't already).
+ Create a new record set in the hosted zone.
+ Select `A - IPv4 address` as the record type.
+ Enable the `Alias` option and select the appropriate target for your Lambda function (e.g., an API Gateway endpoint or a load balancer).
+ Save the record set.

4. Configure API Gateway (if needed):

+ If you want to expose your Lambda function as a REST API endpoint, create a new API in the Amazon API Gateway console.
+ Create a new resource and method for your API, and configure it to trigger your Lambda function.
+ Deploy the API to a stage.

5. Test and deploy your serverless application:

+ Use the AWS Lambda console or AWS CLI to test your function and ensure it works as expected.
+ Configure additional resources such as API Gateway routes, IAM permissions, or environment variables if needed.
+ Deploy your serverless application to production.

Please replace `your-aws-account-id`, `your-region`, `your-repository-name`, and `your-domain` with your actual AWS account ID, desired region, ECR repository name, and domain name, respectively.

Once you have completed these steps, your Docker image will run as a Lambda function and be accessible via Route53 from the specified domain name.
