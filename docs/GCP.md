## Kikiola Docker Image x Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

To push the [Kikiola Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/0xnu20/kikiola/) to [Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry), integrate it with Google Cloud DNS, and deploy the Docker image with Google Cloud Run, follow these steps:

1. Push the Docker image to Google Artifact Registry:

   + Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Artifact Registry page.
   + Create a new Docker repository for your Docker images.
   + Tag your Docker image with the Artifact Registry repository URL:

     ```sh
     docker tag 0xnu20/kikiola:latest us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/your-project-id/your-repository-name/your-image-name:latest
     ```

   + Authenticate your Docker client with Artifact Registry:

     ```sh
     gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
     ```

   + Push the tagged image to the Artifact Registry:

     ```sh
     docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/your-project-id/your-repository-name/your-image-name:latest
     ```

2. Deploy the image using Google Cloud Run:
   + Go to the Cloud Run page in the Google Cloud Console.
   + Click `Create Service`.
   + On the 'Create Service' page, in the Container image URL, enter the URL of the image you pushed to the Artifact Registry.
   + (Optional) Adjust other options like region, authentication, and capacity settings per your requirements.

3. Integrate with Google Cloud DNS:
   + Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud DNS page.
   + Create a new DNS-managed zone for your domain (if you haven't already).
   + Add a new record set in the managed zone.
   + For the record type, select `A`.
   + As for the IPv4 address, enter the IP address corresponding to your Cloud Run service.
   + Save the changes to the record set.

4. Configure API Gateway (if needed):
   + Create an API gateway in the Google Cloud Console to expose your Cloud Run service as a REST API endpoint.
   + Define a new API Config and specify the routing to the target Cloud Run service.
   + After configuring the desired API methods, request/response models, and security settings, deploy your API Gateway.

5. Test and deploy your application:
   + Validate the functionality of your Cloud Run service through the Google Cloud Console or Google Cloud SDK.
   + Configure additional elements such as API Gateway policies, environment variables, or service accounts if necessary.
   + When satisfied, deploy your application.

Please replace `your-project-id`, `your-repository-name`, `your-image-name`, and `your-domain` with your GCP project ID, desired repository name, image name, and DNS zone, respectively.

After following these steps, your Docker image will be running on Cloud Run and can be accessed via the domain name configured in Google Cloud DNS, provided DNS propagation has taken place.

The specifics of these methods and commands may vary according to your project configuration and the Google Cloud tools you are using. Always refer to the latest GCP documentation for accurate instructions and best practices.
