## Kikiola Docker Image x Microsoft Azure

To push the [Kikiola Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/0xnu20/kikiola/) to [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/), integrate it with Azure DNS, and launch the Docker image with an Azure Function, follow these steps:

1. Push the Docker image to Azure Container Registry:
   + Open the Azure Portal and create a new Azure Container Registry.
   + Tag your Docker image with the ACR repository URL:

     ```sh
     docker tag 0xnu20/kikiola:latest your-acr-name.azurecr.io/your-repository-name:latest
     ```

   + Authenticate your Docker client with ACR:
     ```sh
     az acr login --name your-acr-name
     ```

   + Push the tagged image to ACR:
     ```sh
     docker push your-acr-name.azurecr.io/your-repository-name:latest
     ```

2. Create a new Azure Function:
   + Open the Azure Portal and navigate to the Azure Functions service.
   + Click on `Create Function App` and provide a name for your function app.
   + Choose `Docker Container` as the publish option and select the appropriate hosting plan.
   + Under `Container Settings,` select the ACR repository and the image you pushed in step 1.
   + Configure the necessary settings for your Azure Function, such as the runtime stack, app settings, and permissions.

3. Integrate with Azure DNS:
   + Open the Azure Portal and navigate to the Azure DNS service.
   + Create a new DNS zone for your domain (if you haven't already).
   + Create a new record set in the DNS zone.
   + Select `A` as the record type.
   + Set the alias target to the appropriate endpoint for your Azure Function (e.g., a custom domain or the default Azure Function URL).
   + Save the record set.

4. Configure Azure API Management (if needed):
   + If you want to expose your Azure Function as a REST API endpoint, create a new instance of Azure API Management in the Azure Portal.
   + Create a new API and configure it to route requests to your Azure Function.
   + Define the necessary API operations, policies, and security settings.
   + Deploy the API to a desired stage.

5. Test and deploy your serverless application:
   + Use the Azure Portal or Azure CLI to test your Azure Function and ensure it works as expected.
   + Configure additional resources such as API Management policies, app settings, or environment variables if needed.
   + Deploy your serverless application to production.

Please replace `your-acr-name`, `your-repository-name`, and `your-domain` with your actual Azure Container Registry name, desired repository name, and domain name, respectively.

Once you have completed these steps, your Docker image will run as an Azure Function and be accessible via Azure DNS from the specified domain name.

The steps and commands may vary slightly depending on your Azure subscription and configuration. For the most up-to-date instructions and best practices, please refer to the Azure documentation.
